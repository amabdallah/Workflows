Workflows to automate and serve water management data

% Matlab script to read, manipulate, and load discharge time series data from 
% cross-tabulated text files into a Microsoft SQL Server ODM Blank Database

% Data provided by Craig Miller and Dave Cole at Utah Division of Water Resources    

% 1. Monthly (547 MonthlyStations or text files)
% 2. Daily (51 MonthlyStations or text files)

% Written and tested by Adel Abdallah
% Started on June 15 2015
% Finsihed on December 7th 2015
% estimated time spent: 70 hours of work

% There are two seprate scripts for discharge time series data. 
% --------------------------------------------------------------
% Daily 
% Monthly


% How does the script work?
% --------------------------------------------------------------
% 1. read each text file: get the name of the station, time range, and data values 
% 2. convet the cross-tabulated data values to time series 
% 3. add metadata: source, unit, method for each site
% 4. prepare the data and its metadata to a strucutre that matches the ODM database tables 
% 5. load metadata, then data values for each site 


% Why do we need this script, or to load data into ODM? Purpose?
% --------------------------------------------------------------
% Craig Miller mentioned these reaons for loading their text files into a database
% "at present we have flat files that only have at most 5 digits of accuracy.
% In models we cannot see changes in systems like the Colorado River from small 
% changes upstream because we just don't have enough accuracy in our data 
% We would also like to have a way of accessing data from different sources 
% through one data hub.  We want to be able to standardize how we keep our data.
% We also would like to be able to query our data for quick analysi."
